To install, just download the study collection and place it in your SierraChart Data folder.

You can then open SierraChart and go to a chart and then choose Studies in the menu and pick this study.

It will prompt you before erasing your existing studies or you can add to your existing studies.

This happens because I have named it with a + at the end.

The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) has popularized these time frames. His YouTube is located here: https://www.youtube.com/@InnerCircleTrader

They are based on the trainings of Alan H. Andrews who said to study the daily highs and lows and gave statistics for which days were most commonly forming the highs and lows. 

This is explained here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKGUu8OQ=/

This study combines a clock and a candle count down timer with the following:

Killzones, Highs and Lows, Volume, Williams %R, 20 minute macros at the top of each hour.

You can see examples of the charts produced here by checking out this site: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK_p2IGs=/

There are images and links to videos that I have produced showing how to use this study.
